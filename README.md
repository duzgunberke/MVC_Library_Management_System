# Mvc_Library_Management_System

/*   Project content and tools used are as follows :
         
         This project consists of 3 basic panels of a library: showcase, admin and user.
         Especially with the dashboard part of the admin panel, I developed a concrete project 
         with SQL structures such as Entity Framework, Trigger, Procedure over Linq queries,
